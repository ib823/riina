## PART VIII: NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create remaining research documents** for all 128 new tracks
2. **Prioritize core tracks** (A, B, C, R, GA, JA)
3. **Begin Coq proof development** for P0 tracks
4. **Establish cross-prover validation** workflow

## CONCLUSION

RIINA requires **183 research tracks** and **~2,500 theorems** to achieve the goal of making all other solutions obsolete. This is achievable with sufficient resources and represents a **permanent competitive moat** that cannot be replicated.

The investment is substantial but the payoff is absolute: **the only formally verified full-stack solution in human history**.
