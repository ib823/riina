# RIINA DOMINANCE STRATEGY - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## The Bottom Line

**871 machine-verified theorems** make RIINA the ONLY programming language with:
- Proven security (not claimed, PROVEN)
- Triple certification readiness (EAL7 + DO-178C + ASIL-D)
- Post-quantum cryptography at NIST Level 5
- Zero admits, zero axioms, all proofs complete
