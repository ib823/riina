## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the **MILITARY HARDENING** objectives for RIINA. All workers MUST incorporate these objectives into their track work.

**Goal:** Make RIINA the MOST SECURE software framework in human history, suitable for:

## 8. SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Definition of "Military-Grade"

RIINA achieves MILITARY-GRADE when ALL of the following are TRUE:

```
□ Zero axioms in critical proofs (or axioms are semantically justified)
□ All crypto implemented and passing NIST test vectors
□ Translation validation working (compiler untrusted)
□ Hardware contracts formalized (side-channels modeled)
□ Termination provable for all military code
□ Memory safety provable for all military code
□ Concurrency safety provable for all military code
□ Fault tolerance tested under simulated hardware failures
□ Post-quantum crypto deployed
□ Independent security audit passed
```

### Definition of "Invulnerable" (Asymptotic Goal)

RIINA approaches INVULNERABILITY when ALL of the following are TRUE:

```
□ Custom verified silicon (no hardware trojans possible)
□ Hermetic bootstrap from hex0 (supply chain untrusted)
□ Radiation-hardened deployment (EMP resistant)
□ Autonomous operation (jamming irrelevant)
□ Byzantine fault tolerance (mesh networking)
□ Self-healing (damage recovery)
□ Continuous evolution (adapt to new threats)
```

**Note:** TRUE 100% invulnerability is physically impossible. The goal is to make the cost of attack exceed the value of any target.
