\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document contains the Isabelle/HOL port of RIINA's formal proofs.
RIINA is a formally verified programming language with Bahasa Melayu syntax
and mathematical security guarantees.

This port provides independent verification of the original Coq proofs,
implementing multi-prover validation for absolute confidence in correctness.

\section{Introduction}

RIINA (Rigorous Immutable Invariant, No Assumptions) is the world's first
formally verified programming language with native Bahasa Melayu keywords.
All security properties are mathematically proven in Coq, and this document
contains the independent Isabelle/HOL verification.

\subsection{Multi-Prover Validation}

The RIINA project employs multi-prover verification:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Coq 8.20.1} (Primary): Original proofs
\item \textbf{Lean 4} (Secondary): Independent port
\item \textbf{Isabelle/HOL} (Tertiary): This document
\end{itemize}

Agreement across all three provers provides maximum confidence that the
formalization is correct and not dependent on prover-specific bugs.
